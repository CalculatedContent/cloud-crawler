Basic Issues TODO  for / with Pierre and Dave

1.   Make sure INSTALL.local is upto date

1.a  do the examples all run properly AS IS ?

1.b  does rake work?  do all the unit tests work?  
  probably not--but this is an excellent place to start


2.  Create a GIT Tag
  
2.a get the unit tests stabilized and all existing functionality locked
  down.  

2.b create a GIT tag with Gemfile.lock that manages the depenencies


3.  Create INSTALL.aws   instructions
  
3.a   set up ENV VARs  for   AWS

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
EC2_AVAILABILITY_ZONE
EC2_REGION

and CHEF:

CHEF_AMI_ID=ami-d70c2892  (unbuntu small on EC2_REGION=us-west-1 )
CHEF_USER=charlesmartin14
CHEF_PEM=/Users/charlesmartin14/.ssh/cms_aws_3.pem
CHEF_KEY=cms_aws_3


3.b create CHEF_KEY , S3 bucket with proper permissions
same as we did for  Katie

3.b  run

 deploy_chef_server.sh

  make sure knife.rb is correct

3.c run 

  deploy_cloud_master.sh

  deploy_cloud_worker.sh



4.  add support for JSON
   jsons store, not page store?
    store raw html, xml, or json in long term storage
    crawl => page is an json doc, so might need different call
    api_crawl => different dsl, only json, and not follow links
      expose json directly
      expose common apis with translation table if possible
      crunchbase.search
      crunchbase.xxx
      
      these can be 'dsl plugins' for each api
      
5.  make a real buglist ... set up bugzilla or list github issues

6.  make sure crawler still works for recipies
    set up large recipe crawls and run
