Basic Issues TODO  for / with Pierre and Dave

1.   Make sure INSTALL.local is upto date

1.a  do the examples all run properly AS IS ?

1.b  does rake work?  do all the unit tests work?  
  probably not--but this is an excellent place to start


2.  Create a GIT Tag
  
2.a get the unit tests stabilized and all existing functionality locked
  down.  

2.b create a GIT tag with Gemfile.lock that manages the depenencies


3.  Create INSTALL.aws   instructions
  
3.a   set up ENV VARs  for   AWS

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
EC2_AVAILABILITY_ZONE
EC2_REGION

and CHEF:

CHEF_AMI_ID=ami-d70c2892  (unbuntu small on EC2_REGION=us-west-1 )
CHEF_USER=charlesmartin14
CHEF_PEM=/Users/charlesmartin14/.ssh/cms_aws_3.pem
CHEF_KEY=cms_aws_3


3.b create CHEF_KEY , S3 bucket with proper permissions
same as we did for  Katie

3.b  run

 deploy_chef_server.sh

  make sure knife.rb is correct

3.c run 

  deploy_cloud_master.sh

  deploy_cloud_worker.sh
